AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice, significantly affecting patients’ quality of life. Therefore, attempting to understand the underlying mechanisms of this arrhythmic condition is of utmost importance, and one way to do that is through in silico simulations. In this context, my research project aims to simulate the mechanisms of AF in 3D computational models of atria using the openCARP software. openCARP is an open-source in silico cardiac electrophysiology simulator that allows simulations at the level of individual cells or even at the level of organs and has already been used by the group for simulations on 2D surfaces.',

The platform includes methods such as Transfer Function Analysis (TFA) and Autoregulation Index (ARI), as well as filtering and visualization tools. Technical documentation for these methods, including manuals and explanatory videos, is available to assist users in utilizing the platform. Recently, two new methods have been undergoing validation and integration into the CAAos platform: the ARI method modeled using the Autoregressive Moving Average technique (ARI-ARMA) and the non-invasive mean flow index (nMxa) method. My research and work within the group involve developing documentation for these methods, including technical manuals and explanatory videos, to facilitate their utilization in clinical centers. This step is crucial for promoting the use of the platform, which can contribute to multicenter studies in evaluating neurological disorders. It is believed that the CAAos platform, with its open-source code and technical documentation, can assist in establishing methodological guidelines for assessing cerebral circulation. This is an important objective for the group of researchers involved in the CARNet network.',
