AF is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice, significantly affecting patients’ quality of life. Therefore, attempting to understand the underlying mechanisms of this arrhythmic condition is of utmost importance, and one way to do that is through in silico simulations. In this context, my research project aims to simulate the mechanisms of AF in 3D computational models of atria using the openCARP software. openCARP is an open-source in silico cardiac electrophysiology simulator that allows simulations at the level of individual cells or even at the level of organs and has already been used by the group for simulations on 2D surfaces.',

        undergrad_resume: 'Researchers from the Federal University of ABC (UFABC) and the University of São Paulo (FMUSP) have developed the CAAos platform (Cerebral Autoregulation Assessment Open Source) to assess cerebral autoregulation, a physiological mechanism that controls cerebral blood flow (CBF) in response to variations in arterial blood pressure (ABP). The platform includes methods such as Transfer Function Analysis (TFA) and Autoregulation Index (ARI), as well as filtering and visualization tools. Technical documentation for these methods, including manuals and explanatory videos, is available to assist users in utilizing the platform. Recently, two new methods have been undergoing validation and integration into the CAAos platform: the ARI method modeled using the Autoregressive Moving Average technique (ARI-ARMA) and the non-invasive mean flow index (nMxa) method. My research and work within the group involve developing documentation for these methods, including technical manuals and explanatory videos, to facilitate their utilization in clinical centers. This step is crucial for promoting the use of the platform, which can contribute to multicenter studies in evaluating neurological disorders. It is believed that the CAAos platform, with its open-source code and technical documentation, can assist in establishing methodological guidelines for assessing cerebral circulation. This is an important objective for the group of researchers involved in the CARNet network.',

Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common forms of arrhythmia , and, although there are clinical researches, mathematical models, and other technologies available, the mechanism of the AF is still not entirely understood. My project is related to that. Using the openCARP software and its python framework – carputils – the goal is to run some simulations using pre-existing mathematical/computational models, such as Countermanche’s; firstly simulating healthy hearts, then introducing some irregularities, in order to better understand the propagation of atrial electrical activity.',

One particular physiological mechanism to maintain these characteristics is the Cerebral Autoregulation (CA), which controls the cerebral blood flow (CBF) once there is a variation of the arterial blood pressure (ABP) due to activities as physical exercises or sleeping. To analyze the CA, techniques such as Transfer Function Analysis (TFA) and Autoregulation Index (ARI) are mathematical and processing signals methods to quantify how is the CA of a health or neurological subjects. My research is to study the CA through the platform CAAos (Cerebral Autoregulation Assessment Open Source) by applying a new method in the software. The Mx method is a mathematical technique which is commonly used in the scientific community and it has the function to evaluate the CA through the data of CBF velocity and ABP means, resulting an index that indicates how well is the subjects CA.',
